### Max Payne ~ Widescreen Launcher 

This launcher is based on an older **widescreen fix** by **ThirteenAG** --- you should now use the latest version at [https://thirteenag.github.io](https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#mp1), along with my latest [**UniGame Launcher**](https://github.com/alex47exe/UniGame-Launcher/releases)

***Features:***

- automatically detects resolution and modifies it to *Scripts\MP1_widescreen_fix.ini*
- launches the game on first cpu core if `RunFirst = 1` in *MaxPayne_Launcher.ini*

------

***Requirements:***

1. Max Payne - v1.0.4.0
